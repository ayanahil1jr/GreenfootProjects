PROJECT TITLE:
Desert Clicker

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: 
  The Greenfoot project is an edutainment tool that serves as an introduction to fundamental tenets of object-oriented programming and game development. I hoped that by doing this project, I would better understand some of the more basic programming concepts, including inheritance, polymorphism, and event-driven programming. In addition, it shows that I can design user interfaces, handle real-time game mechanics, and manage graphical assets in a well-defined object-oriented environment. 

Also, the project shows my interest in developing engaging and intuitive applications for both education and entertainment. I've strengthened my problem-solving skills during the course of this project, as well as my ability to work with game engines and a basic understanding of game development workflows.
